## Developer Notes

- The `node_modules` folder is not put in the repo, so whenever you pull changes, make sure to run `npm install` to install dependencies that might be added by others
- To start the app run `npm run dev` to start a local server
- The Hosted page will automatically update on any pushes to `main` branch
- Place all test files `<test_name.test.ts>` in `test/` folder
- run `npm run test` to run all tests
- Make sure all the tests passes before you push to the repo
